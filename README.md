# Local One Off
## Introduction

During this pandemic, many people are in need of things to do while others need services or gigs done for them. 

This application is intended to target local communities where people can search for gigs to perform and others can post gigs that need done.
The purpose is more of a volunteer type of gigs.  People can see if it’s a charity in the listing  or if people are willing to pay.
